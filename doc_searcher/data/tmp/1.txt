Eventually all Boost libraries may use these     formats, but in the meantime, much of Boost's documentation is not     available here.  Please     see http://www.boost.org/libs     for complete documentation.             Documentation for some of the libraries described in this document is       available in alternative formats:         HTML          PDF
